    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>

          Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
          can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
          make it easier.

          12-inch circle.
        </p>
