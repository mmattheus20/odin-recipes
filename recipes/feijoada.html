      <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
      <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
      <li>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion,
          green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4
          minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover
          beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low,
          and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.
        </p>

        <p>
          While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup
          chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the
          bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until
          mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves,
          coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</p></li>
