Hello World! My name is Matheus and I started The Odin Project recently, this project is just the beginning of many things I want to build around here, I used my basic html knowledge to create this website, and I kind of liked the result. By the way, I'm Brazilian so my English must be bad, but I hope to improve it as time goes by. (Note: Feijoada is a very traditional recipe here in Brazil, so I felt I couldn't leave something like that out, the other two I chose randomly).

I got all the recipes from allrecipes.com, all credits go to the people who posted these recipes there.

Obrigado ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
